Concept: THEME

DEFINITION	VALUE	A THEME of an event is an object that is acted upon. Fillers of THEMES are usually meanings of direct objects. If the direct object denotes an event, then CAUSED-BY must be used

IS-A	VALUE	CASE-ROLE

DOMAIN	SEM	EVENT

INVERSE	VALUE	THEME-OF

RANGE	SEM	EVENT
		OBJECT
		SCALAR-PHYSICAL-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE


Inherited from: CASE-ROLE

NOTES	VALUE	All inverses of case roles have been included in the case-role subtree; no reason (except linguistic convention) to split them into case-role and case-role-inverse as we formerly did since every property has an inverse and including a separate subtree for each set of inverses is not needed.
