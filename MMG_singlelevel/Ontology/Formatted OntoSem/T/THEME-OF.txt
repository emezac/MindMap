Concept: THEME-OF

DEFINITION	VALUE	an object is the theme of a movement-action if it is the argument that changes its location or orientation; see further explanation under THEME.

IS-A	VALUE	CASE-ROLE

DOMAIN	SEM	EVENT
		OBJECT

INVERSE	VALUE	THEME

RANGE	SEM	EVENT


Inherited from: CASE-ROLE

NOTES	VALUE	All inverses of case roles have been included in the case-role subtree; no reason (except linguistic convention) to split them into case-role and case-role-inverse as we formerly did since every property has an inverse and including a separate subtree for each set of inverses is not needed.
