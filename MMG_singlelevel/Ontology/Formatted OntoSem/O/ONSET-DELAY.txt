Concept: ONSET-DELAY

DEFINITION	VALUE	the amount of time between the time that something is done and its effect -- e.g., a medication might start working only after 24 hours. Onset delay can be a property of an object, like medication, or an event, like drinking alcohol. In the former case, it is a shorthand but a very convenient one, since onset delays for medicines should be recorded with the medicines themselves.
