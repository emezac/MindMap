Concept: SIMILARITY

DEFINITION	VALUE	the degree to which things are (towards 1) or are not (towards 0) similar (note: this will need to become a microtheory in which we seek the values of salient properties that are implicity compared). The domain will generally be a set, so if X and Y are similar, then the set [X,Y] has similarity of, say, < .7. NOTE: there is a special scalar for SIMILARITY-PHYSICAL

IS-A	VALUE	SCALAR-ATTRIBUTE

NOTES	VALUE	"since this is, in effect, a 3-place property, the domain will generally be a set: i.e., if X and Y are similar, then the set [X, Y] has SIMILARITY of, say, > .7"
