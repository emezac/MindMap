NOTES	VALUE	Here's the general guideline we use for specifying shapes - distinguish between 2D and 3D shapes (where 2D just means mostly flat, not strictly 2D). 2D: circular, curved, linear, parallelepiped, rectangular, semicircular, sheetlike, squarelike, triangular, spirallike; 3D: blocklike, conical, cylindrical, egglike, halftoroidal, hornlike, knoblike, pyramidlike, spherical, toroidal; either 2D or 3D: amorphous, barlike, crosslike, trapezoidal.
