Concept: PRECISION-ATTRIBUTE

DEFINITION	VALUE	an attribute that indicates the precision of something - whether it is precise, approximate, etc. Note that this is not the same as accuracy, which says whether it's right or wrong (something can be, for example, correct but at a coarse grain size so therefore imprecise)
