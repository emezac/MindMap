NOTES	VALUE	This subtrees will tell us among other things- where to look for default themes for light verbs like 'make'. E.g., 'make a cake'. In order to more specifically understand the meaning of make, we will look in this CREATE-ARTIFACT subtree and see which concept most narrowly defaults its theme to CAKE. We decided to do this rather than have a special relation like PRODUCED-BY-EVENT defined for each relevant object. That method would also have worked but it would have been less procedural. The way well do it, if we don't find any concept that narrowly has the given theme as a default, we will fail-soft to CREATE-ARTIFACT (actually, no special procedure is needed for this since defaulting to a higher concept is our general procedure). The effect of fail-softing here is to have almost a semantic ellipsis i.e., an underspecification of the exact type of event involved in creating the given object.
