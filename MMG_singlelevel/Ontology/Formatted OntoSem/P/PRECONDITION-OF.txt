Concept: PRECONDITION-OF

DEFINITION	VALUE	the relation that describes the state or property that sets up the precondition

IS-A	VALUE	REASON

DOMAIN	SEM	EVENT
		PROPERTY

INVERSE	VALUE	PRECONDITION

NOTES	VALUE	The typical case is for the domain or range to be an EVENT. When it is a PROPERTY, it's the existence of that property that is in question: e.g., 'His impatience makes me mad'. It is also possible, in language, for objects to be listed as preconditions and effects: 'The onions made her cry'. This is actually an ellipsis - there was an event in which the onions played a role that made her cry. We have special rules in the analyzer that instantiate an event and use the object as one of its roles.
