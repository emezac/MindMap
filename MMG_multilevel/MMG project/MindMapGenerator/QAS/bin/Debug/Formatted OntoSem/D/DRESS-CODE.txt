NOTES	VALUE	Eventually, this should be expanded into a big tree covering "attire", which can include everything from overalls to swimsuits to wedding wear. There should be divisions based on, e.g., formal/informal, male/female, Arab/Australian, etc. The DOMAIN might need to be sth. like social roles.
