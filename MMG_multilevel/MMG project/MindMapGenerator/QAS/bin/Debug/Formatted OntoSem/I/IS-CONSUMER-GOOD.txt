Concept: IS-CONSUMER-GOOD

DEFINITION	VALUE	A binary property to define whether an artifact is a consumer good - goods such as food and clothing that satisfy human wants through their direct consumption or use - or not.

IS-A	VALUE	PHYSICAL-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE

DOMAIN	SEM	INANIMATE

NOTES	VALUE	We decided to make this a property in order to most accurately specify things that are consumer goods - couldn't do inheritance of siblings (i.e. CONSUMER-GOODS is-a artifact; can't put its siblings in is-a positions to it)
