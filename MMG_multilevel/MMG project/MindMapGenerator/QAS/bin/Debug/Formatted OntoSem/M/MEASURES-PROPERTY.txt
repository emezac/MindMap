Concept: MEASURES-PROPERTY

DEFINITION	VALUE	this property is used to specify what property is measured when one measures something: e.g., if one measures a table, it might be its length, width, height; with verbs other than 'measure', there can be even more ambiguity: 'evaluate the race conditions' can mean measuring the air temperature, slipperiness of the surface, etc. Thus, property-measured is generally used in conjunction with an indication of the thing measured: e.g., measure theme: table, property-measured: height.
