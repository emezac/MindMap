Concept: EXTENT-OF-CHANGE

DEFINITION	VALUE	indicates the extent to which an OBJECT changes as the result of a change event; this is not intended to circumvent property-based reasoning, it is intended to be used when it would be difficult if at all possible to determine what properties are being referred to: e.g., My car has changed a lot over these past few years.
